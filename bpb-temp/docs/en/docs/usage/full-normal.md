![Full Normal subscription](../images/full-normal-sub.jpg)

This subscription includes all **Normal** configs while automatically applying optimal VLESS and Trojan settings, DNS servers, routing rules etc., minimizing user errors. It also includes a **Best Ping** config.

???+ question "What is the **Best Ping** config?"
    This config aggregates all panel configs and checks every 30 seconds to identify and connect to the fastest one. If youâ€™ve added Clean IPs, enabled the Trojan protocol, or selected additional ports, these are included in the **Best Ping** config too. This feature is also available in Fragment and Warp subscriptions.

With routing settings applied, this subscription blocks approximately 90% of Iranian and foreign ads, bypasses Iranian, Chinese, and Russian websites (eliminating the need to disable the VPN for payment gateways), bypasses LAN, blocks porn and QUIC protocol, and for Sing-box and Clash subscriptions, effectively blocks phishing and malware content.
