# :material-lan-connect:{ .md .middle } How to use

For beginners, I recommend using **Full Normal** or **Fragment** subscriptions, as they have all required settings for a successfull connection. These subscriptions provide **VLESS** and **Trojan** configs.

!!! info
    Please don't use **Normal** subscription unless you read all related documentation and configured your client beforehand.

On the other hand, **Warp** and **Warp Pro** which provide **WireGuard** configs, need scanning some endpoints first. You can refer to [this guide](../configuration/warp.md) to learn how to scan some endpoints.
