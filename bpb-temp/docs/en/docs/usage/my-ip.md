# :material-fingerprint:{ .md .middle } My IP

![My IP](../images/my-ip.jpg)

After connecting to the proxy, refresh this section and check it to view your IPs. The table displays two rows:

- The first row shows your node IP for Cloudflare target addresses. If a Proxy IP is set, this will be your IP for Cloudflare addresses, while other target addresses use a random Cloudflare IP. This allows you to verify if the Proxy IP is functioning.
- If using Warp configs, both rows should display the same IP.

!!! warning
    Disable extensions like `uBlock` or `AdGuard`, Otherwise this section won't work properly.
