## Endpoints - Scanner

Endpoints for Warp function similarly to Clean IPs for VLESS and Trojan. The panel provides a scanner script that you can run on Termux (Android) or Linux and input the results here. Note that the results are not 100% reliable, so testing is necessary.

!!! info
    - Endpoints are formatted as IP:Port or Domain:Port and must be entered one per line.
    - For IPv6 addresses, enclose them in square brackets. See the example below:

    Endpoint examples:
    ```title="IPv4"
    123.45.8.6:1701
    ```
    ```title="IPv6"
    [2a06:98c1:3120::3]:939
    ```
    ```title="Domain"
    engage.cloudflareclient:2408
    ```  

## Fake DNS

You can enable Fake DNS for Warp configs to reduce DNS latency. However, use caution, as it may be incompatible with some applications or interfere with system DNS. If you're unsure about its functionality, avoid enabling it.

## Enabling IPv6

If your ISP does not support IPv6, disable it to optimize DNS and proxy performance.

## Updating Warp configs

Updating the subscription retrieves new Warp configs from **Cloudflare**. This process does not affect connection speed.

## Best Interval

**Warp** and **Warp Pro** subscriptions include **Best Ping** configs. By default, these test configs every 30 seconds to identify the optimal config or Endpoint for connection. On slower networks, this interval may cause lag during activities like video streaming or gaming. You can adjust the interval between 10 and 90 seconds.
